## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2023-09-09

### Added

- The minimum supported Rust version is now defined as 1.70. Previously it was undefined.
- Wrappers for `std::sync` primitives can now be `const` constructed.
- Add support for `std::sync::OnceLock`
- Added backtraces of mutex allocations to the cycle report. Capturing backtraces does incur some
  overhead, this can be mitigated by disabling the `backtraces` feature which is enabled by default.

### Breaking

- Update [`parking_lot`][parking_lot] dependency to `0.12`.
- Restructured the crate to reduce typename verbosity. Wrapper names now match the name of the
  primitive they wrap. Specific always/debug tracing versions have now moved to separate modules.
  For example, `tracing_mutex::stdsync::TracingMutex` is now
  `tracing_mutex::stdsync::tracing::Mutex`, and `tracing_mutex::stdsync::DebugMutex` is now called
  `tracing_mutex::stdsync::Mutex`. This hopefully reduces the visual noise while reading code that
  uses this in practice. Unwrapped primitives are reexported under `tracing_mutex::stdsync::raw` for
  convenience.

### Fixed

- Enforce that all internal mutex guards are `!Send`. They already should be according to other
  reasons, but this adds extra security through the type system.

## [0.2.1] - 2022-05-23

### Added

- Build [docs.rs] documentation with all features enabled for completeness.
- Add support for `std::sync::Condvar`

### Fixed

- The `parkinglot` module is now correctly enabled by the `parkinglot` feature rather than the
  `lockapi` feature.

## [0.2.0] - 2022-05-07

### Added
- Generic support for wrapping mutexes that implement the traits provided by the
  [`lock_api`][lock_api] crate. This can be used for creating support for other mutex providers that
  implement it.

- Support for [`parking_lot`][parking_lot] mutexes. Support includes type aliases for all
  provided mutex types as well as a dedicated `Once` wrapper.

- Simple benchmark to track the rough performance penalty incurred by dependency tracking.

### Breaking

- The library now requires edition 2021.

- The `Mutex`- and `RwLockGuards` now dereference to `T` rather than the lock guard they wrap. This
  is technically a bugfix but can theoretically break existing code.

- Self-cycles are no longer allowed for lock dependencies. They previously were because it usually
  isn't a problem, but it can create RWR deadlocks with `RwLocks`.

### Changed

- The project now targets edition 2021

## [0.1.2] - 2021-05-27

### Added
- Added missing type aliases for the guards returned by `DebugMutex` and `DebugRwLock`. These new
  type aliases function the same as the ones they belong to, resolving to either the tracing
  versions when debug assertions are enabled or the standard one when they're not.

### Fixed
- Fixed a corruption error where deallocating a previously cyclic mutex could result in a panic.

## [0.1.1] - 2021-05-24

### Changed
- New data structure for interal dependency graph, resulting in quicker graph updates.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where internal graph ordering indices were exponential rather than sequential. This
  caused the available IDs to run out way more quickly than intended.

## [0.1.0] - 2021-05-16 [YANKED]
