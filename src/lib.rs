//! Mutexes can deadlock each other, but you can avoid this by always acquiring your locks in a
//! consistent order. This crate provides tracing to ensure that you do.
//!
//! This crate tracks a virtual "stack" of locks that the current thread holds, and whenever a new
//! lock is acquired, a dependency is created from the last lock to the new one. These dependencies
//! together form a graph. As long as that graph does not contain any cycles, your program is
//! guaranteed to never deadlock.
//!
//! # Panics
//!
//! The primary method by which this crate signals an invalid lock acquisition order is by
//! panicking. When a cycle is created in the dependency graph when acquiring a lock, the thread
//! will instead panic. This panic will not poison the underlying mutex.
//!
//! This conflicting dependency is not added to the graph, so future attempts at locking should
//! succeed as normal.
//!
//! # Structure
//!
//! Each module in this crate exposes wrappers for a specific base-mutex with dependency trakcing
//! added. This includes [`stdsync`] which provides wrappers for the base locks in the standard
//! library, and more depending on enabled compile-time features. More back-ends may be added as
//! features in the future.
//!
//! # Feature flags
//!
//! `tracing-mutex` uses feature flags to reduce the impact of this crate on both your compile time
//! and runtime overhead. Below are the available flags. Modules are annotated with the features
//! they require.
//!
//! - `backtraces`: Enables capturing backtraces of mutex dependencies, to make it easier to
//!   determine what sequence of events would trigger a deadlock. This is enabled by default, but if
//!   the performance overhead is unaccceptable, it can be disabled by disabling default features.
//!
//! - `lockapi`: Enables the wrapper lock for [`lock_api`][lock_api] locks
//!
//! - `parkinglot`: Enables wrapper types for [`parking_lot`][parking_lot] mutexes
//!
//! # Performance considerations
//!
//! Tracing a mutex adds overhead to certain mutex operations in order to do the required
//! bookkeeping. The following actions have the following overhead.
//!
//! - **Acquiring a lock** locks the global dependency graph temporarily to check if the new lock
//!   would introduce a cyclic dependency. This crate uses the algorithm proposed in ["A Dynamic
//!   Topological Sort Algorithm for Directed Acyclic Graphs" by David J. Pearce and Paul H.J.
//!   Kelly][paper] to detect cycles as efficently as possible. In addition, a thread local lock set
//!   is updated with the new lock.
//!
//! - **Releasing a lock** updates a thread local lock set to remove the released lock.
//!
//! - **Allocating a lock** performs an atomic update to a shared counter.
//!
//! - **Deallocating a mutex** temporarily locks the global dependency graph to remove the lock
//!   entry in the dependency graph.
//!
//! These operations have been reasonably optimized, but the performance penalty may yet be too much
//! for production use. In those cases, it may be beneficial to instead use debug-only versions
//! (such as [`stdsync::Mutex`]) which evaluate to a tracing mutex when debug assertions are
//! enabled, and to the underlying mutex when they're not.
//!
//! For ease of debugging, this crate will, by default, capture a backtrace when establishing a new
//! dependency between two mutexes. This has an additional overhead of over 60%. If this additional
//! debugging aid is not required, it can be disabled by disabling default features.
